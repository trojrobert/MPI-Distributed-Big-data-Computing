## Distribution process
+ P0 is the master process
+ P0 will divide the datasets in rows and each row is assigned to P processes, including P0.
+ P0  generates k random centroids.
+ All processes are responsible for computing the local mean of the datasets received through the scatter process.
+ Once, local mean calculated inside each P, the sum of each individual local mean is reduced at P0.
+ P0 then compute the global mean for P processes.
+ Determines if the program has converged to K centroids by comparing previous centroid with global mean.
